## Yilgarn :: Exploring the economics of gold investment

### What is this repository for?
**Yilgarn** (an Australian Aboriginal word for white quartz, a common indicator of gold) is self-interest project exploring the economics of investing in gold. This project is partly an opportunity to explore when, if ever, it makes sense for gold to be part of an investment portfolio, and also an opportunity to develop my python and associated programming skills.

### Ideas explored
Initial list of ideas to explore include:
- Gold as an inflation hedge
- Gold correlation with real interest rates
- Gold correlation with other major investment classes e.g. S&P500

### Format and code
I will primarily be using Jupyter notebooks to explore the different ideas (stored in the `nb` directory), and pulling in relevant code repositaries that I come across that are interesting and useful to me.
